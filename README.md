# C++ - Simple Math Interpreter

I made this for fun, so there may or may not be some bad practice or anything like that! If there is an issue, I'm willing to fix it, but I do not have a lot of knowledge with C++.

An interpreter, written in C++, that can evaluate simple math calculations.

# Running the program

If you are using GCC, there is a [gcc_compile.txt](https://github.com/jackprogramsjp/CPP-Simple-Math-Interpreter/blob/master/gcc_compile.txt), so you can compile the interpreter into exe file.
